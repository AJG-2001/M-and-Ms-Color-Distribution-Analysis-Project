M&M’s Color Distribution Analysis – Group Project

📌 Project Overview

This project applies statistical concepts to a real-world dataset by analyzing the distribution of colors in M&M’s candies. The objective was to determine whether M&M colors are randomly distributed or follow a specific pattern. Using observational sampling, descriptive statistics, and hypothesis testing, we explored potential causes behind distribution patterns and discussed strategic implications for the manufacturer.

🔎 Research Question & Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H₀): M&M’s colors are randomly distributed (equally proportioned).

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): M&M’s colors follow a particular pattern of distribution
.

Question: Are M&M’s colors randomly distributed when packaged?

📊 Data Collection

Purchased M&M packages from multiple stores to ensure independence.

Collected 10 random M&M samples per package and recorded the color frequencies.

Logged data in Google Sheets for collaborative analysis
.

📈 Data Analysis & Techniques
Descriptive Statistics

Higher observed frequencies of orange M&Ms, lower frequencies of brown M&Ms.

Yellow and green colors showed wider variability, while blue and red had occasional outliers
.

Quality Control

Constructed control charts for each color’s frequency.

Most data points fell within control limits, validating sample collection methods.

Increasing the sample size would improve accuracy
.

Hypothesis Testing

Chi-Squared Test:

Result: p-value < 0.001

Conclusion: Reject H₀ → M&M colors are not equally distributed
.

Additional test against Mars’ published plant proportions (Hackettstown, NJ & Cleveland, OH) confirmed alignment with factory-set distributions
.

🔍 Insights & Conclusions

Distribution is intentional, not random. Orange appears more frequent; brown less so.

Possible causes: Cost of food dyes (blue, yellow, red are pricier), with brown having less marketing appeal
.

Marketing Psychology: Orange and red stimulate appetite, explaining higher frequencies in consumer packs
.

💡 Strategic Recommendations

Mars could reduce the high-cost blue dye proportion (currently ~25% in NJ plant) and increase red M&Ms, achieving both cost savings and greater appetite appeal
.

Further analysis could explore seasonality impacts on M&M sales and color preferences.

🚀 Key Takeaways

M&M color distribution is strategic, not random.

Statistical tools (Chi-Squared, QC Charts) revealed patterns aligning with factory-set ratios.

Insights extend beyond candy: this project shows how data-driven decision-making can uncover hidden strategies in consumer goods.
